This is my project on creating a semantic search system for MUNI courses. Since my final goal is to make something really helpful, its name is Pomáharýk (T.G. Pomáharýk is the full name :))

Current outline of the project:

- web-crawler module to parse info about the courses
- creation of a vector database
- semantic search
- experiments with different models
- evaluations and results

  The structure will be extended and developed regularly! Stay tuned.
